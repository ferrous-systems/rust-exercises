# Binary Size

ELF files contain metadata like debug information so their size on disk is not a good indication of the amount of Flash the program will use once it's loaded on the target device's memory.

To display the amount of Flash the program will occupy on the target device use the `cargo-size` tool, which is part of the `cargo-binutils` package.

âœ… Use the following command to print the binary's size in system V format.

``` console
cargo size --bin hello -- -A
```

Expected output: The breakdown of the program's static memory usage per *linker section*.

```console
$ cargo size --bin hello -- -A

**ðŸ”Ž More details about each linker section:**

The first three sections are contiguously located in Flash memory -- on the nRF52840, flash memory spans from address `0x0000_0000` to `0x0010_0000` (i.e. 1 MiB of flash).

* The `.vector_table` section contains the *vector table*, a data structure required by the Armv7E-M specification
* The `.text` section contains the instructions the program will execute
* The `.rodata` section contains constants like strings literals

Skipping `.gnu.sgstubs` (which is empty), the next few sections - `.data`, `.bss` and `.uninit` - are located in RAM. Our RAM spans the address range `0x2000_0000` - `0x2004_0000` (256 KB). These sections contain statically allocated variables (`static` variables), which are either initialised with a value kept in flash, with zero, or with nothing at all.

The remaining sections are debug information, which we ignore for now. But your debugger might refer to them when debugging!
