# Dealing with unknown requests: Stalling the endpoint

You may come across host requests other than the ones listed in previous sections.

For this situation, the USB specification defines a device-side procedure for "stalling an endpoint", which amounts to the device telling the host that it doesn't support some request.

> This procedure should be used to deal with invalid requests, requests whose `SETUP` stage doesn't match any USB 2.0 standard request, and requests not supported by the device – for instance the `SET_DESCRIPTOR` request is not mandatory.

✅ Use the `dk::usbd::ep0stall()` helper function to stall endpoint 0 in `nrf52-code/usb-app/src/bin/usb-4.rs` if an invalid request is received.
