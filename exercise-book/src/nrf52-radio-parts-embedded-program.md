# Parts of an Embedded Program

We will look at the elements that distinguish an embedded Rust program from a desktop program.

✅ Open the `nrf52-code/radio` folder in VS Code.

```console
# or use "File > Open Folder" in VS Code
code nrf52-code/radio
```

✅ Then open the `src/bin/hello.rs` file.

## In the file, you will find the following attributes:

### `#![no_std]`

 The `#![no_std]` attribute indicates that the program will not make use of the standard library, the `std` crate. Instead it will use the `core` library, a subset of the standard library that does not depend on an underlying operating system (OS).

### `#![no_main]`

The `#![no_main]` attribute indicates that the program will use a custom entry point instead of the default `fn main() { .. }` one.

### `#[entry]`

The `#[entry]` attribute declares the custom entry point of the program. The entry point must be a divergent function whose return type is the never type `!`. The function is not allowed to return; therefore the program is not allowed to terminate.
