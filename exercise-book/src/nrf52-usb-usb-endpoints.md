# USB Endpoints

![USB hierarchy diagram showing the relationship between configurations, interfaces and endpoints. The diagram consists of nested rectangles. In this version of the diagram all the endpoint rectangles are highlighted in blue. The outermost rectangle is labeled 'device' and represents the complete USB device. Inside the 'device' rectangle there is one rectangle labeled 'configuration 1'; this rectangle has a 'parallel lines' symbol that indicates there may be more than one configuration instance; the symbol is labeled 'bNumConfigurations=1' indicating that this device has only one configuration. Inside the 'configuration 1' rectangle there are two rectangles labeled 'control endpoint' and 'interface 0'. Inside the 'control endpoint' rectangle there are two rectangles labeled 'endpoint 0 IN' and 'endpoint 0 OUT. The 'interface 0' rectangle has a 'parallel lines' symbol that indicates there may be more than one interface instance; the symbol is labeled 'bNumInterfaces=1' indicating that this configuration has only one interface. Inside the 'interface 0' rectangle there are three rectangles labeled 'endpoint 1 IN', 'endpoint 2 IN' and 'endpoint 2 OUT'. Between these three rectangle there is a label that says 'bNumEndpoints=3'; it indicates that this interface has only three endpoints.](img/usb-all-endpoints.svg)

Under the USB protocol data transfers occur over *endpoints*.

Endpoints are similar to UDP or TCP ports in that they allow logical multiplexing of data over a single physical USB bus. USB endpoints, however, have directions: an endpoint can either be an IN endpoint or an OUT endpoint. The direction is always from the perspective of the host so at an IN endpoint data travels from the device to the host and at an OUT endpoint data travels from the host to the device.

Endpoints are identified by their address, a zero-based index, and direction. There are four types of endpoints: control endpoints, bulk endpoints, interrupt endpoints and isochronous endpoints. Each endpoint type has different properties: reliability, latency, etc. In this workshop we'll only need to deal with control endpoints.

All USB devices must use "endpoint 0" as the default control endpoint. "Endpoint 0" actually refers to two endpoints: endpoint 0 IN and endpoint 0 OUT. This endpoint pair is used to establish a *control pipe*, a bidirectional communication channel between the host and device where data is exchanged using a predefined format. The default control pipe over endpoint 0 is mandatory: it must always be present and must always be active.

Going back to our [enumeration steps](./nrf52-usb-usb-enumeration.md), we are expecting the host to request our Device Descriptor using a `GET_DESCRIPTOR` request sent over the *control pipe*. Later, we will expect the device to send us a `SET_ADDRESS` request, giving us our new USB address - again, over the *control pipe*.

For detailed information about endpoints check Section 5.3.1 *Device Endpoints*, in the [USB 2.0 specification][usb_spec]. Or you can look at [Chapter 3 of USB In a Nutshell](https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb3.shtml#Endpoints).
