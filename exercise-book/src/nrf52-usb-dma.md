# Direct Memory Access

ðŸ”Ž this section covers the implementation of the `Ep0In` abstraction; it's not necessary to fully understand this section to continue working on the exercise.

Let's zoom into the `Ep0In` abstraction we used in `usb-3.rs`.

This is how data transfers over USB work on the nRF52840: for each endpoint there's a buffer in the USBD peripheral. Data sent by the host over USB to a particular endpoint will be stored in the corresponding endpoint buffer. Likewise, data stored in one of these endpoint buffers can be send to the host over USB from that particular endpoint. These buffers are not directly accessible by the CPU but data stored in RAM can be copied into these buffers; likewise, the contents of an endpoint buffer can be copied into RAM. A second peripheral, the Direct Memory Access (DMA) peripheral, can copy data between these endpoint buffers and RAM. The process of copying data in either direction is referred to as "a DMA transfer".

What the `start` method does is start a DMA transfer to copy `bytes` into endpoint buffer IN 0; this makes the USBD peripheral send data to the host from endpoint IN 0 fs. The data (`bytes`), which may be located in Flash or RAM, is first copied into an internal buffer, allocated in RAM, and then the DMA is configured to move the data from this internal buffer to endpoint buffer 0 IN, which is part of the USBD peripheral.

The signature of the `start()` method does *not* ensure that:

- `bytes` won't be deallocated before the DMA transfer is over (e.g. `bytes` could be pointing into the stack), or that
- `bytes` won't be modified right after the DMA transfer starts (this would be a data race in the general case).

For these two safety reasons the API is implemented using an internal buffer called `buffer`. The internal buffer has a `'static` lifetime so it's guaranteed to never be deallocated -- this prevents issue (a). The `busy` flag prevents any further modification to the internal buffer -- from the public API -- while the DMA transfer is in progress.

Apart from thinking about lifetimes and explicit data races in the surface API one must internally use memory fences to prevent reordering of memory operations (e.g. by the compiler), which can also cause data races. DMA transfers run in parallel to the instructions performed by the processor and are "invisible" to the compiler.

In the implementation of the `start` method, data is copied from `bytes` to the internal buffer (a `memcpy()` operation) and then the DMA transfer is started with a write to the `TASKS_STARTEPIN0` register. The compiler sees the start of the DMA transfer (register write) as an unrelated memory operation so it may move the `memcpy()` to *after* the DMA transfer has started. This reordering results in a data race: the processor modifies the internal buffer while the DMA is reading data out from it.

To avoid this reordering a memory fence, `dma_start()`, is used. The fence pairs with the *store* operation (register write) that starts the DMA transfer and prevents the previous `memcpy()`, and any other memory operation, from being move to *after* the store operation.

Another memory fence, `dma_end()`, is needed at the end of the DMA transfer. In the general case, this prevents instruction reordering that would result in the processor accessing the internal buffer *before* the DMA transfer has finished. This is particularly problematic with DMA transfers that modify a region of memory which the processor intends to read after the transfer.

> Note: Not relevant to the DMA operation but relevant to the USB specification, the `start()` method sets a shortcut in the USBD peripheral to issue a STATUS stage right after the DATA stage is finished. Thanks to this it is not necessary to manually start a STATUS stage after calling the `end` method.
