## Icons and Formatting we use

We use Icons to mark different kinds of information in the book:

- ✅ Call for action
- ❗️ Warnings, Details that require special attention
- 🔎 Knowledge, that gets you deeper into the subject, but you do not have to understand it completely to proceed.
- 💬 Descriptions for Accessibility

> Note: Notes like this one contain helpful information

## Course Material

We have attempted to make our material as inclusive as possible. This means, that some information is available in several forms, for example as a picture and as a text description. We also use icons so that different kinds of information are visually distinguishable on the first glance. If you are on a course and have accessibility needs that are not covered, please let us know.
