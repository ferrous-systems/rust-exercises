# Note: the use of the html subdirectory here is deliberate.
# a) it allows the book to be provided as PDF in the future
# b) it ensures the `../../exercise-solutions` links in the markdown also work
#    when loaded from this output folder. The `../..` comes about
#    because the Markdown book source lives in the `src` subfolder and so you
#    have to go up one extra level. Adding an extra level in the output
#    is easier than re-writing all the links at build time.
